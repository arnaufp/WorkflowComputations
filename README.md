# Workflow Computations

This repository is intended to store and be used as a reference library for any useful workflow computation as well as their related C# scripts, use cases that solves, workflow diagram screenshots or any other relevant information.

Therefore, the aim is to document:
- Basic or generic computations that others can easily search for and reuse 
- As well as more bespoke solutions that could be slightly changed to be reused by other customers
